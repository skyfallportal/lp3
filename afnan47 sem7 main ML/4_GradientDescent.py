This Python script implements the Gradient Descent algorithm to find the local minimum of a function. In this example, the function is \(y = (x + 3)^2\), and the algorithm starts from the point \(x = 2\). Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. Initialize Parameters:
   - `cur_x`: The initial point where the algorithm starts (set to 2).
   - `rate`: The learning rate, which determines the step size in each iteration (set to 0.01).
   - `precision`: The minimum change in `x` that indicates convergence (set to 0.000001).
   - `previous_step_size`: Initialize it to 1 for the first iteration.
   - `max_iters`: The maximum number of iterations (set to 1000).
   - `iters`: Initialize the iteration counter to 0.
   - `df`: The derivative (gradient) of the function \(y = (x + 3)^2\), which is \(2 \cdot (x + 3)\).

2. Run a Loop to Perform Gradient Descent:
   - Inside the loop, the previous value of `cur_x` is stored in `prev_x`.
   - The new value of `cur_x` is updated using the gradient descent formula: \(x = x - \text{rate} \cdot \text{df}(x)\).
   - The `previous_step_size` is updated as the absolute difference between the previous and current values of `cur_x`.
   - The `iters` counter is incremented in each iteration.

3. Termination:
   - The loop continues until one of the two conditions is met: `previous_step_size` is smaller than the `precision` or the maximum number of iterations (`max_iters`) is reached.

4. Print the Local Minimum:
   - After the loop terminates, the local minimum is printed as the final value of `cur_x`.

The code essentially uses the gradient descent method to iteratively update the value of `x` to find the local minimum of the given function \(y = (x + 3)^2\). The algorithm continues until the change in `x` becomes very small (less than the specified precision) or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

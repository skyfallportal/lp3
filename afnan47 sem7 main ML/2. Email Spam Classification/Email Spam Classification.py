This Python script performs classification on an email dataset using two different machine learning models: Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Here's an explanation of the code:

1. Import necessary libraries:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.svm import SVC
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
   from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
   ```

2. Load the "emails.csv" dataset:

   ```python
   df = pd.read_csv("./emails.csv")
   ```

   The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

3. Check for missing values:

   ```python
   df.isnull().sum()
   ```

   The code checks for missing values in the dataset.

4. Split the data into features (X) and labels (Y):

   ```python
   X = df.iloc[:, 1:3001]
   Y = df.iloc[:, -1].values
   ```

   Features are selected from the columns 1 to 3000, and the target labels are extracted.

5. Split the data into training and testing sets:

   ```python
   train_x, test_x, train_y, test_y = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.25)
   ```

   The dataset is split into training (75%) and testing (25%) sets.

6. Train a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model:

   ```python
   svc = SVC(C=1.0, kernel='rbf', gamma='auto')
   svc.fit(train_x, train_y)
   ```

   A Support Vector Classifier model is trained with the specified parameters.

7. Make predictions using the SVC model and calculate accuracy:

   ```python
   y_pred2 = svc.predict(test_x)
   print("Accuracy Score for SVC: ", accuracy_score(y_pred2, test_y))
   ```

   The model's accuracy is calculated using the test data.

8. Split the data into training and testing sets for K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):

   ```python
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
   ```

   The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets for KNN.

9. Train a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier with 7 neighbors:

   ```python
   knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=7)
   knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

   A KNN classifier is trained with 7 neighbors.

10. Make predictions and calculate the accuracy of the KNN model:

    ```python
    print(knn.predict(X_test))
    print(knn.score(X_test, y_test))
    ```

    The model's predictions and accuracy on the test data are printed.

This script demonstrates the use of two different classification algorithms, SVC and KNN, on the email dataset and evaluates their performance using accuracy scores.

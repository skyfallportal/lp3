This Python script visualizes the gradient descent optimization process for finding the local minimum of a function. In this example, the function to minimize is \(y = (x + 3)^2\). Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. Import necessary libraries:

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import pandas as pd
   import sympy as sym
   import matplotlib as pyplot
   from matplotlib import pyplot
   ```

   The script imports libraries for numerical computation, symbolic mathematics, and plotting.

2. Define the objective function and its derivative:

   ```python
   def objective(x):
       return (x + 3) ** 2

   def derivative(x):
       return 2 * (x + 3)
   ```

   The `objective` function represents the function to minimize, and the `derivative` function calculates its derivative.

3. Define a gradient descent function:

   ```python
   def gradient(alpha, start, max_iter):
       x_list = list()
       x = start
       x_list.append(x)
       for i in range(max_iter):
           gradi = derivative(x)
           x = x - (alpha * gradi)
           x_list.append(x)
       return x_list
   ```

   This function performs gradient descent with specified parameters and returns a list of intermediate values of `x`.

4. Calculate the derivative symbolically:

   ```python
   x = sym.symbols('x')
   expr = (x + 3) ** 2.0
   grad = sym.Derivative(expr, x)
   print("{}".format(grad.doit()))
   grad.doit().subs(x, 2)
   ```

   The script uses the `sympy` library to calculate the derivative symbolically and then evaluates it at `x = 2`.

5. Set gradient descent parameters and perform the optimization:

   ```python
   alpha = 0.1
   start = 2
   max_iter = 30
   ```

   The learning rate (`alpha`), initial starting point (`start`), and maximum number of iterations (`max_iter`) are specified.

6. Visualize the optimization process:

   - A range of `x` values is generated for plotting purposes.
   - The original objective function is plotted.
   - The starting point at `x = 2` is marked in red.
   - Gradient descent is performed and the intermediate values of `x` are plotted during each iteration.

This script demonstrates the gradient descent optimization process for finding the local minimum of a quadratic function. It visualizes how the algorithm iteratively updates the value of `x` to approach the minimum.
